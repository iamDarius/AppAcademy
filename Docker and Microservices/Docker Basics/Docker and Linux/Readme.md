# Basics of Docker

Docker is designed to make it easier to create, deploy and run apps using containers. These cotainers allow devs to package up an application with everything it needs (libraries and dependencies) and ships it all out as one package. Containers and Docker are all about packaging, shipping and delivering and sharing apps in a standard way.

From Docker's website, "A **container** is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all of its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A **Docker container image** is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings."

The boot up and redeploying of containers happens in seconds because they are super lightweight and they don't need to start the kernel.
