# AppAcademy

This course cirriculum is a 24 week program that will build skills in the following areas: JavaScript, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, ReactJS, Express, Flask, and SQL Alchemy. 

This is meant to sharpen my programming skills. 

In each folder, there will be a solution file and a regular code file. The solution file will include the suggested solution by the platform provider and the regular files will include the solutions that I implement.
