# AppAcademy
## This course cirriculum is a 24 week program that will build skills in the following areas: JavaScript, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, ReactJS, Express, Flask, and SQL Alchemy. 

### I am personally working through this course to build upon existing knowledge as well as learn new things. In each folder, there will be a solution file and a regular code file. The solution file will include the suggested solution by the platform provider and the regular files will include the solutions that I implement.
