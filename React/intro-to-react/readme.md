# Intro To React

React is a library that manages the creation and updating of DOM nodes on a web page.

React is unopinionated about many aspects of frontend development. It doesn't care how you make AJAX calls. It doesn't really care how your page is laid out. It has a few simple rules that you must follow, and It Just Works.

Things that REACT does not do:
- Ajax
- Services
- Local storage
- provides CSS framework

It ONLY **dynamically renders stuff into the DOM**.
